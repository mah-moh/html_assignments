            <p>
                Developed a CRUD application using Golang, GORM, and Gin framework. Implemented the backend 
                functionalities to handle data persistence, retrieval, modification, and deletion operations. Utilized GORM as 
                an object-relational mapping (ORM) library for simplified database interactions. Integrated Gin, a web 
                framework, to facilitate routing, middleware handling, and request handling. Demonstrated strong problem
                solving skills and attention to detail throughout the development process, resulting in a robust and efficient 
                application.

                        <b>Prediction of earthquakes: A Step Towards Predicting the Unpredictable</b>
                        A group thesis that aims to validate the reliability of existing datasets and methods
                        for predicting earthquakes using machine learning.
                        The thesis presents a
                        comprehensive analysis of existing earthquake prediction methods, as well as a
                        proposal for a new approach that combines multiple prediction techniques.
